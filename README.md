# Task1
## Introduction
After the class, “PIVOT TABLES”, we were given the assignment to create pivot tables using “Medical Students” data given to us by our facilitator Chinonso Promise that contained the Student ID, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Type, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Diabetes, and Smoking columns.

## Tasks
